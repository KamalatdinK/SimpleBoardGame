# Board Game

## The following game is played by two players.

The game board consists of 4 x 4 squares. Both players have 6 stones: one player has 3 red and 3 blue, the other player
has 3 green and 3 yellow. Players take turns placing one of their stones on an empty square. You can't place a stone
next to a stone of the same color (not even diagonally). If a player makes a move that results in a row or column
having 4 stones of 4 different colors, that player wins. If no players can make a move, the game ends in a draw.

When the game is started the program must ask for the names of the players.

The program must store the result of the games as follows.
For each game, the following information must be stored: the date and time when the game was started, the name of the
players, the number of turns made by the players during the game, and the name of the winner. The program should be
able to display a high score table in which the top 5 players with the most wins are displayed. The game must store
data in a database, in a JSON file, or in an XML document.
